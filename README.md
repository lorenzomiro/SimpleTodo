## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I have never used Android Studio before building this app, so I had struggled with finding ways to fix errors and use the tools required to run the app, from the simulator and other features that I needed to use to complete this project. To overcome this, I tried spending (at most) 30 minutes to fix the problem myself as suggested my tech fellows until I had to reach out to them or another tech fellow to get my problems solved.
